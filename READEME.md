# Elm with websocket!

This project is a completion of the exercise:  
The node server is started with npm start and the elm fll with elm reactor.  
mychat.elm is the elm file I worked on.

    Use the following JSON protocol
    { command: "login|send", content: "userName|message" }
    and extend the chat.elm page to:
    1. Send and receive messages in JSON
    2. Display a full list of the last chat messages
    This includes changing the model to contain a list of chat
    messages
    3. Login with a user name
    Implement this either by prexing the user name in the button
    with "login" (so to log in with "Anders" you write
    "loginAnders"), or by creating a new input eld
